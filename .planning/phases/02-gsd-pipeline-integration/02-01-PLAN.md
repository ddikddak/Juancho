<objective>
Create six GSD workspace skills that implement the /gsd:* command interface for Juancho. Each skill adapts the existing GSD methodology (from ~/.claude/get-shit-done/) into OpenClaw's skills format, providing the structured development pipeline.

Purpose: These skills are the primary user interface for Juancho's GSD workflow. They translate user commands into structured project management operations, leveraging OpenClaw's existing workspace and sub-agent orchestration.

Output: Six SKILL.md files in ~/.openclaw/workspace-juancho/skills/ that implement project initialization, phase planning, execution, verification, research, and discussion.

  <action>
Create two workspace skills:

**gsd-new-project/SKILL.md:**
- Frontmatter: name "gsd-new-project", description covering what it does AND when to trigger (per OpenClaw skill-creator guidance). Triggers on "/gsd:new-project", "start a new project", "initialize project", "create .planning".
- Body workflow:
  1. Intensive questioning stage (adapt from questioning.md reference): Start open, follow energy, challenge vagueness, make abstract concrete. Use the "4 things" checklist: what they're building, why it exists, who it's for, what done looks like.
  2. Create .planning/ directory structure: PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, config.json, phases/ directory.
  3. Use templates from ~/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/ as the structure reference.
  4. config.json defaults: mode "interactive", depth "standard", autonomy_level "moderate", commit_docs true.
  5. Git init .planning/ commit with conventional format.
- Keep SKILL.md body under 300 lines. Core workflow only, reference GSD templates by path.
- Do NOT duplicate template content - reference it: "Read ~/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/project.md for structure"

**gsd-discuss-phase/SKILL.md:**
- Frontmatter: name "gsd-discuss-phase", description covering when to trigger ("/gsd:discuss-phase N", "discuss phase N", "let's talk about phase N").
- Body adapts the discuss-phase.md workflow: validate phase from roadmap, identify gray areas, present with selection, discussion loop (4 questions per area then check), write CONTEXT.md.
- Keep under 200 lines. Reference the full workflow for edge cases.

IMPORTANT: Skills are Markdown files read by Juancho (the AI agent). They are NOT code - they are structured instructions. Use imperative form ("Read STATE.md", "Create .planning/ directory", NOT "This skill reads STATE.md").

Watch the 20k OpenClaw bootstrapMaxChars limit - keep both files well under this. Aim for 150-250 lines each.

    Both files exist:

Create four workspace skills:

**gsd-plan-phase/SKILL.md:**
- Triggers: "/gsd:plan-phase N", "plan phase N", "plan the next phase"
- Workflow: Read STATE.md + ROADMAP.md, determine phase, load CONTEXT.md + RESEARCH.md if they exist, spawn gsd-planner subagent with full context (inline content since @ doesn't cross Task boundaries), wait for PLAN.md files, update STATE.md + ROADMAP.md with plan count.
- Reference gsd-planner.md methodology (at ~/.claude/agents/gsd-planner.md) for the planner subagent. The skill is the ORCHESTRATOR, the planner agent does the actual planning.
- Supports --gaps flag for gap closure planning from verification failures.
- Keep under 250 lines.

**gsd-execute-phase/SKILL.md:**
- Triggers: "/gsd:execute-phase N", "execute phase N", "run the plans for phase N", "build phase N"
- Workflow adapts execute-phase.md: validate phase, discover plans (find PLAN.md without matching SUMMARY.md), group by wave (from frontmatter), execute each wave (spawn gsd-executor subagents in parallel using sessions_spawn), handle checkpoints, aggregate results.
- Sub-agent prompts must inline plan content (@ syntax does not cross Task boundaries).
- Supports --gaps-only flag to execute only gap_closure plans.
- After all plans complete, spawn gsd-verifier subagent for goal-backward verification.
- Keep under 300 lines (this is the most complex skill).

**gsd-verify-phase/SKILL.md:**
- Triggers: "/gsd:verify-phase N", "verify phase N", "check if phase N is done"
- Workflow: Load phase goal from ROADMAP, load must_haves from PLAN.md frontmatter, check each truth/artifact/key_link against actual codebase, create VERIFICATION.md with pass/fail per item.
- Reference verify-phase.md for the full verification logic.
- Keep under 150 lines.

**gsd-research-phase/SKILL.md:**
- Triggers: "/gsd:research-phase N", "research phase N", "research before planning phase N"
- Workflow: Read ROADMAP.md for phase goal, use browser (WebFetch/WebSearch) and codebase analysis to research domain, document findings in {phase}-RESEARCH.md within phase directory.
- Covers BROW-01 requirement: browser research runs before coding.
- Keep under 150 lines.

SAME CONSTRAINTS as Task 1: imperative form, reference GSD templates by path, no content duplication, under bootstrapMaxChars limit.

    Six total GSD skills exist in workspace-juancho/skills/ covering the full GSD pipeline: new-project, discuss-phase, research-phase, plan-phase, execute-phase, verify-phase.

    Skills reference existing GSD templates and workflows by path, not duplication.
