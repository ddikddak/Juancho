# Requirements: Juancho

**Defined:** 2026-02-14
**Core Value:** An AI developer that follows real engineering discipline and works proactively — writes the plan, then autonomously executes it phase by phase via cron/heartbeat, only interrupting humans for blockers and decisions.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Developer Identity

- [x] **IDEN-01**: System prompts (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md) rewritten for coding-focused developer persona, reusing OpenClaw's existing workspace file system
- [x] **IDEN-02**: Onboarding flow redesigned as Juancho-branded developer experience (not generic assistant setup — walks user through repo connection, git config, AI provider setup, first project definition)
- [x] **IDEN-03**: Juancho developer persona with engineering discipline baked into all interactions, leveraging OpenClaw's existing agent identity system
- [x] **IDEN-04**: Coding-specific Telegram commands reusing OpenClaw's existing native command system (nativeCommand on all GSD skills + /commit, /test utilities)

### GSD Workflow Pipeline

- [x] **GSD-01**: Full GSD pipeline integrated (.planning/ directory with research, requirements, roadmap, phases), reusing OpenClaw's workspace directory and file I/O tools
- [x] **GSD-02**: Intensive project definition stage at task start (structured questioning before coding), leveraging OpenClaw's existing conversation/session system
- [x] **GSD-03**: Phase-based execution: research → plan → build → test per phase, orchestrated via OpenClaw's tool system
- [x] **GSD-04**: Configurable autonomy levels (user decides how much Juancho asks vs. decides), stored in workspace config
- [x] **GSD-05**: Task stack tracking across all phases (what's done, in progress, blocked, pending), persisted in .planning/ state files

### Proactive Autonomy (Cron/Heartbeat)

- [x] **PROA-01**: Heartbeat cron job (reusing OpenClaw's existing cron/heartbeat system) that periodically checks work status and determines next action
- [x] **PROA-02**: Self-directed phase transitions (agent decides to move to next phase when tests pass)
- [x] **PROA-03**: Configurable proactivity schedule (active hours, frequency, intensity)
- [x] **PROA-04**: When blocked, agent autonomously researches alternatives or works on other tasks
- [x] **PROA-05**: Plan persistence — full plan written to .planning/ files, cron reads and executes
- [x] **PROA-06**: Status reporting via Telegram at phase transitions and when blocked

### Git Workflow

- [x] **GIT-01**: Git commits per phase with conventional commit format
- [x] **GIT-02**: Feature branches per project/milestone
- [x] **GIT-03**: Pull request creation with summary of changes
- [x] **GIT-04**: Branch naming conventions enforced

### Testing & QA

- [x] **TEST-01**: Test-first discipline — run tests after each code change
- [x] **TEST-02**: Checkpoint validation — test suite must pass before moving to next phase
- [x] **TEST-03**: Build verification — ensure project builds successfully per phase
- [x] **TEST-04**: Error detection and debugging — surface failures, don't suppress them

### Browser & Research

- [x] **BROW-01**: Browser research phase before coding (docs, APIs, patterns, examples)
- [x] **BROW-02**: Headless browser on VPS with Xvfb for reliable browser automation
- [x] **BROW-03**: Web app testing via browser (verify built features actually work)

### Documentation

- [x] **DOCS-01**: GSD planning docs per project (.planning/ with research, requirements, roadmap)
- [x] **DOCS-02**: Code documentation generation (README, API docs, inline comments)
- [x] **DOCS-03**: Work logs with decisions, reasoning, and tradeoffs documented

### Infrastructure

- [x] **INFR-01**: Telegram as primary interface with rich formatting (code blocks, files, buttons) — INHERITED from OpenClaw (verified)
- [x] **INFR-02**: Remote VPS deployment with headless browser infrastructure — INHERITED from OpenClaw (verified)
- [x] **INFR-03**: Multi-provider AI support (keep OpenClaw's existing flexibility) — INHERITED from OpenClaw (verified)
- [x] **INFR-04**: Upstream sync capability (pull OpenClaw improvements without breaking customizations) — INHERITED from OpenClaw (verified)
