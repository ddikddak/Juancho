# Project Milestones: Juancho

## v1.0 MVP (Shipped: 2026-02-15)

**Delivered:** Autonomous AI developer built on OpenClaw with full GSD methodology, git automation, proactive heartbeat execution, and Telegram command interface — all via workspace configuration with zero source code modifications.

**Phases completed:** 1-4 (10 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Developer identity established via workspace files (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, IDENTITY.md) with upstream sync maintained
- Full GSD pipeline integrated with 8 orchestration skills: new-project, discuss, research, plan, execute, verify, status, resume
- Git workflow automation: feature branches, test enforcement gates, conventional commits, PR creation via gh CLI
- Heartbeat-driven proactive autonomy with configurable schedule (interval, active hours, timezone)
- 11 Telegram commands via nativeCommand frontmatter + utility wrappers (/status, /execute, /verify, /research, /plan, /discuss, /newproject, /onboard, /resume, /commit, /test)
- Onboarding flow, per-plan work log generation, and documentation auto-generation with timeout protection

**Stats:**

- 29 files created/modified
- 5,866 lines of configuration/documentation
- 4 phases, 10 plans, 22 commits
- 12 hours from first commit to ship (2026-02-15 00:08 to 12:04 CET)

**Git range:** `docs(01)` → `docs(04)`

**What's next:** Deploy to VPS, test with real projects, validate workspace overrides with running OpenClaw instance
