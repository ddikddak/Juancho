# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** An AI developer that follows real engineering discipline and works proactively — writes the plan, then autonomously executes it phase by phase via cron/heartbeat, only interrupting humans for blockers and decisions.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Developer Identity & Persona

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Developer Identity & Persona)
Plan: None yet (phase planning needed)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-14 — Roadmap revised to 4 phases (consolidated from 5, moved infrastructure verification and UX wrappers to Phase 4)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: - min
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: None yet
- Trend: Baseline

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Fork OpenClaw rather than build from scratch (Massive existing capability - reconfigure, don't rebuild)
- Telegram as primary interface (Already supported in OpenClaw, always accessible)
- Full GSD pipeline integration (User's core pain point is AI tools lacking discipline)
- Configurable autonomy over fixed behavior (Intensive questioning at start, minimal interruption during execution)
- Headless browser on VPS (Browser use critical for research, testing, context gathering)

**Roadmap revision decisions:**
- Infrastructure requirements (INFR-01 through INFR-04) treated as inherited from OpenClaw, verification only in Phase 4
- Onboarding (IDEN-02) and Telegram commands (IDEN-04) moved to Phase 4 as thin wrappers over functionality built in earlier phases
- Phase 1 focused purely on developer identity/persona (system prompts rewrite)
- Consolidated from 5 phases to 4 to match depth=quick setting (3-5 phases)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
